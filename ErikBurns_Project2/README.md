GVR_SDK_VERSION = "1.0";

= Total Completion Time =
1-2 days (including learnings and creative exploration)

= What I Liked =
I liked the creativity of this project, it gave me a chance to flex my creative
muscles a bit, going above and beyond with spatial design and adding a few extra
touches like animating the clock and creating a "soundtrack" for the scene,
which combined a "now playing" album on the TV set and background rain sounds
to suggest a more lively outdoors in the "woods" beyond the apartment.

= What I found Challenging =
I find Unity pretty overwhelming in general. I am beginning to get the hang of it,
but when I try to branch out into the online documentation and do things on my own,
I don't have lots of success. For instance, I wanted to make the globe "pause"
on click rather than "jump back to the beginning" every time. The jumping animation
feels kind of buggy and unpolished. I found some online references about how to do
it, but had little success implementing them given my current level of Unity
knowledge. Perhaps once I learn more about Unity scripting it will be easier!

= Notes on Lighting Settings =
I found there were significant lighting artifacts when I used compressed lighting, so I switched to uncompressed. The app still performed reasonably well on my Google Pixel phone.

Great project!
